<h1>Raven's Garden</h1>
                        <address>
                                And the Raven's, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting <br>
                                On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
                                And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
                                And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
                                And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
                                Shall be lifted-nevermore!
                        </address>

                                <p>To the left you will see an image styled with the "float_left" class. It applies the correct margins as well. If you haven't already guessed it, there is a "float_right" class as well. Next, we can show off what a link looks like: That was fun. Why don't you check out this. You can use the 'strong' or 'b' tag; they are both styled exactly the same. This <i>italicized text</i> looks swell, don't you think?</p>
