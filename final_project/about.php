<h1>About us</h1>

<p>This is a place for rebels, the black sheep of the family. </p>
<p>I found my family in art, music and my style.  I had the not giving 2 f#cks attitude since coming out of the womb.</p>
<p>We all have it in us... Some more, some less. </p> 

<h3>The question is do you embrace it? </h3>
